SSL G-Equalizer Controls and Indicators
1. High pass filter (white knobs on the left) 18 dB/octave, 16 Hz – 350 Hz. Filter
in/out switch, with indicator.
2. Low frequency EQ section (black knobs) Shelving. Range 30 Hz – 450 Hz. Gain
range ±17 dB.
3. Low medium frequency EQ section (blue knobs) Range 200 Hz – 2.5 kHz. Q is
continuously adjustable from 0.1 to 3.5. Gain varies from ±20 dB when Q is set at
3.5, to ±15 dB when Q is set at 0.1. The ÷3 button divides the selected frequency
by three (e.g., if you have selected a center frequency of 300 Hz, pressing the ÷3
button will result in a frequency of 100 Hz.)
4. High medium frequency EQ section (green knobs) Range 600 Hz – 7 kHz. As
in the LMF EQ section, Q is continuously adjustable from 0.1 to 3.5. Gain varies
from ±20 dB when Q is set at 3.5, to ±15 dB when Q is set at 0.1. The x3 button
allows you to multiply the selected frequency by three.
5. High frequency EQ section (purple knobs) Range 1.5 kHz – 16 kHz. Gain range
±17 dB, shelving.
6. EQ IN (far right) The EQ IN button bypasses the EQ section but leaves the filter in
(if engaged.)
7. Phase reverse (ø) This button reverses the phase of the input signal.
8. Master Output (far right) Master Output fader controls overall output of the
processor.
9. Trim button Above the meter display is a trim button (12). Pressing the trim
button will trim the output level by the amount indicated on the button this trim will
bring you to -0.1db in peak which is the full 24bit output level. A positive indication
in this mode expresses how much headroom you have remaining. A negative
display indicates how much you must reduce your signal to avoid digital clipping.
10. Analogue on/off. Classic analogue processors necessarily create more noise and
harmonic distortions than modern digital devices. This is, in part, what gives
analogue processors their desired sound. By default, all components of the SSL 
SSLEQ page 4
4000 Collection operate in a mode which enables emulation of the SSL console.
However, there may be times when you prefer to use this plug-in without these
special attributes. Switching off Analogue disables analogue emulation.
